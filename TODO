we could optimize out the after-call failure check when calling a
procedure that can't fail (because it accepts epsilon)

N.B. g0() (the string parser) has a redundant test at the start, because
it doesn't know that all the calling contexts have the test already

generate this code (in root()) -- or something equivalent:
    case '-':
      c = advance (s);
      // Fall through
    case '0':
it's worth about 0.04s on the migrated dataset

check that root and Recur's firstset and has_null are consistent
